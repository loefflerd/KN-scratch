# The ramification groups of an ideal

Let a group `G` act by ring automorphisms on a commutative ring `B`, and let `Q` be an ideal of
`B`. The **ramification groups** of `Q` are the inertia subgroups of the powers of `Q`:

`Q.ramificationGroup G i = {σ | ∀ x : B, σ • x - x ∈ Q ^ (i + 1)}`, for `i : ℕ`.

For a Galois extension of number fields `L/K`, with `G = Gal(L/K)` acting on `𝓞 L` and `Q` a
nonzero prime of `𝓞 L`, these are Hilbert's ramification groups `G_i` of `Q`, the global form of
the lower-numbering filtration of Serre's *Corps Locaux*. They are indexed by `ℕ`, so that `G_0`
is the inertia group of `Q`; the decomposition group, the stabilizer of `Q`, contains every `G_i`
but is not itself a member of the family.

## Main definitions

* `Ideal.ramificationGroup G Q i`: the `i`-th ramification group of `Q`.

## Main results

* `Ideal.mem_ramificationGroup_iff`: the defining congruence `σ • x ≡ x mod Q ^ (i + 1)`.
* `Ideal.ramificationGroup_zero`: `G_0` is the inertia group `Q.inertia G`.
* `Ideal.ramificationGroup_antitone` and `Ideal.ramificationGroup_le_stabilizer`: the groups
  decrease and lie in the decomposition group.
* `Ideal.ramificationGroup_smul`: moving `Q` by `g` conjugates its ramification groups by `g`, and
  `Ideal.instNormalRamificationGroupStabilizer` makes each `G_i` normal in the decomposition group.
* `Ideal.iInf_ramificationGroup_eq_ker` and `Ideal.exists_forall_ramificationGroup_eq_bot`: for a
  proper ideal `Q` of a Noetherian domain the filtration cuts out the kernel of the action, and a
  faithful action with finite inertia group has `G_i = 1` for all large `i`.
