# Frobenius elements for a group acting on a ring extension

This file supplements Mathlib's `IsArithFrobAt` API with facts about a monoid or group acting on
a commutative ring extension `S/R`. All of them are stated at ring level, so they are available
independently of any number-field or Legendre-symbol specialization.

Two are properties of a single Frobenius element. The defining congruence has `#(R ⧸ Q ∩ R)` as
its exponent, so it makes that residue ring finite and therefore forces `Q ≠ ⊥` over an infinite
base. Iterating it `n` times replaces the exponent by its `n`-th power, which is what a Frobenius
over an intermediate ring of residue degree `n` is required to satisfy.

For an ideal `p` of `R`, an element `σ` of the acting group cuts out the set of primes of `S` above
`p` that admit `σ` as an arithmetic Frobenius. These sets need not be disjoint: at a ramified prime
several elements are a Frobenius at once, so this is a family of fibers rather than a partition.
Disjointness at a prime `Q` is what `IsArithFrobAt.eq_of_isUnramifiedAt` below supplies, under
hypotheses of its own: a faithful action, `S` Noetherian, `Q.primeCompl ≤ S⁰`, and
`Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt R Q`. Exhaustion of the primes above `p` needs a Frobenius to exist at
each of them, which again carries hypotheses of its own, such as those of
`IsArithFrobAt.exists_of_isInvariant`.

## Main results

* `IsArithFrobAt.eq_of_isUnramifiedAt` — a Frobenius element is unique for a faithful action at an
  unramified prime of a Noetherian ring whose prime complement consists of non-zero-divisors.
* `IsArithFrobAt.ne_bot` — a prime carrying a Frobenius element over an infinite base ring is
  nonzero.
* `IsArithFrobAt.mk_pow_smul` — the `n`-th power of a Frobenius element acts on the residue ring
  by the `q ^ n`-th power map.
* `Ideal.nonempty_frobenius_fiber_equiv_of_isConj` — conjugate elements have equipotent fibers
  above a fixed ideal of the base, as a bijection between them.
* `Ideal.frobenius_fiber_card_eq_of_isConj` — the `Nat.card` form of that equipotence.

The equipotence is the "distributed evenly" step of Chebotarev's density theorem: where the fibers
do partition the primes above `p`, it is what lets a count over a whole conjugacy class be
recovered from the count at a single representative. Because `S` is an arbitrary commutative ring
the fibers may be infinite, and `Nat.card` is `0` on an infinite type; the bijection is therefore
the primary statement and the `Nat.card` identity is derived from it.

## Implementation notes

The bijection realizing the equipotence is not conjugation itself but the pointwise action
`P ↦ c • P` of a witnessing element `c`; Mathlib's `IsArithFrobAt.conj` is what transports the
Frobenius condition along it, sending a Frobenius `σ` at `P` to the Frobenius `c * σ * c⁻¹` at
`c • P`.

The source states the equipotence for the rings of integers of a Galois extension of number
fields and under an unramifiedness hypothesis on `p` that it never uses. Both restrictions are
dropped here: the transport argument uses only the generic Frobenius group-action API, and it is
available at every prime.

/-- **Powers of an arithmetic Frobenius raise the exponent.** If `σ` is an arithmetic Frobenius at
`Q`, then `σ ^ n` acts on the residue ring `S ⧸ Q` as the `q ^ n`-th power map, where
`q = #(R ⧸ Q ∩ R)`.

This is the congruence a tower formula rests on: over an intermediate ring whose prime below `Q`
has residue ring of cardinality `q ^ n`, the `n`-th power of a Frobenius over the base satisfies
the defining congruence of a Frobenius over that intermediate ring. -/
