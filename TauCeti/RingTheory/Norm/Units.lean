# The norm on unit groups

The norm `Algebra.norm R : S →* R` of an `R`-algebra is multiplicative, so it sends units to
units. `TauCeti.Algebra.normUnits` packages that as a homomorphism `Sˣ →* Rˣ`. This is the form a
statement about the norm of an invertible element wants: the value is a unit by construction, so
no choice of proof that it is nonzero has to be carried alongside it.

No finiteness hypothesis is needed here, because `Algebra.norm` itself has none: it is the
determinant of multiplication, which is `1` when `S` is not module-finite over `R`
(`Algebra.norm_eq_one_of_not_module_finite`). A consumer that cares about the value — for instance
the non-split torus of `GL₂` in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/NonSplitTorus.lean` — supplies its own
finiteness where the value is computed.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Algebra.normUnits`: the algebra norm read as a homomorphism `Sˣ →* Rˣ`.
* `TauCeti.normGroup`: the image of the norm on units in a finite field extension.
