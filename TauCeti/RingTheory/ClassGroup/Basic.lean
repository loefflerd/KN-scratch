# Complements on the ideal class group

Four facts about Mathlib's `ClassGroup R` and its principal-ideal map that Mathlib's own file does
not carry: the kernel of `toPrincipalIdeal`, the generator form of triviality of a class, that a
principal fractional ideal has trivial class, and the class `[v]` of a height one prime.

## Main definitions

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.classGroupMk`: the class `[v]` of a height one prime of a
  Dedekind domain.

## Main results

* `FractionalIdeal.toPrincipalIdeal_eq_one_iff`: the kernel of the principal-ideal homomorphism is
  the image of `Rˣ`, that is, `(u)` is trivial exactly when `u` comes from a unit of `R`. This is
  the left end of the ideal class exact sequence. The underlying computation is Mathlib's
  `Submodule.span_singleton_eq_one_iff`, reached by coercing the fractional ideal to a submodule.
* `ClassGroup.mk_eq_one_iff_exists`: a class is trivial exactly when some `x : Kˣ` generates it.
  This is Mathlib's `ClassGroup.mk_eq_one_iff` with `Submodule.IsPrincipal` traded for the range
  of `toPrincipalIdeal`, which is the form a consumer that wants to *name* the generator can use.
* `ClassGroup.mk_toPrincipalIdeal`: a principal fractional ideal has trivial class. This is the
  `simp` form of `ClassGroup.mk_eq_one_iff` for the one witness that arises in practice, and it
  holds over any domain.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.classGroupMk_eq_mk0`: the defining formula for `[v]`, as
  `ClassGroup.mk0` of `v.asIdeal`. This needs no fraction field.
* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.classGroupMk_eq_mk`: `[v]` is the class of `v.asIdeal` seen
  as an invertible fractional ideal of any fraction field `K`.

All are stated at the weakest hypotheses their proofs need: the two class-triviality results over
`[IsDomain R]`, since nothing in either is Dedekind-specific, and `toPrincipalIdeal_eq_one_iff`
over a plain `[CommRing R]`, since routing it through Mathlib's submodule lemma needs no domain
hypothesis at all. None
of them needs the factorization of a fractional ideal into primes, so this file does not import
it; the results that do live in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.ClassGroup.HeightOneSpectrum`, which every consumer of *those* pays for and
consumers of these do not.
