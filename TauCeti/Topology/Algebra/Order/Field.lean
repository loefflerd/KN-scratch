# Ratios whose denominator diverges

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Order/Field.lean` proves
`tendsto_bdd_div_atTop_nhds_zero`: a numerator confined to a fixed interval, divided by a
denominator that diverges to `atTop`, tends to `0`. This file records the companion statement
for a numerator that is *not* bounded but instead tracks the denominator: if `f` agrees with `g`
up to a two-sided additive bounded error and `g` diverges, then `f / g` tends to `1`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.tendsto_div_nhds_one_of_le_add_const_of_sub_const_le` — if `g` tends to `atTop`
  along `l` and,
  eventually along `l`, `g - C₂ ≤ f ≤ g + C₁` for constants `C₁` and `C₂`, then `f / g` tends
  to `1`. No property of the denominator beyond divergence is used: the additive error washes
  out because `g` blows up.

## Implementation notes

The two error bounds are taken as separate `∃ C, ∀ᶠ …` hypotheses rather than as a single
bound on `|f - g|`, because a caller that derives the two inequalities from different estimates
arrives holding them in that shape and would otherwise have to recombine them.

over `ℝ`; the statement here is over an arbitrary linearly ordered topological field.
