# Elementary frontier lemmas

Facts about `frontier` that carry no structure of their own: straddling, splitting a domain in
two, clinging to it from inside, the frontier of an image, and the frontier of a finite union.
Each is the topological core of a step that a boundary argument would otherwise carry out inside
a concrete space. The list is open-ended; nothing below depends on how many entries it has.

## A connected set that straddles a set meets its frontier

A preconnected set that meets both a set `V` and its complement must meet `frontier V`: it cannot
cross from the inside of `V` to the outside without touching the boundary. This is the
intermediate-value principle in its purely topological form, and it is the mechanism by which a
*path* leaving a set produces a *boundary point* of that set.

Mathlib records the two extreme cases — `frontier_eq_empty_iff` and `nonempty_frontier_iff` say
that in a preconnected *space* the frontier of `V` is empty exactly when `V` is `∅` or `univ` — but
not this relative form, which is the one an argument along a segment or a path needs. No hypothesis
is placed on `V`; only preconnectedness of the straddling set is used.

The proof is the standard clopen argument: the complement of `frontier V` is the disjoint union of
the two open sets `interior V` and `interior Vᶜ` (`compl_frontier_eq_union_interior`), so a
preconnected set avoiding the frontier lies inside one of them, and then it misses `V` entirely or
is contained in `V` entirely.

## Where the boundary of the image of one side of a split domain can lie

Split a set `U` into two pieces `s` and `t` that a map `f` sends to *disjoint open* sets, plus a
remainder `u`. Then `frontier (f '' s) ⊆ f '' u ∪ frontier (f '' U)`
(`TauCeti.frontier_image_subset_image_union_frontier_image`): the boundary of the image of one side
consists of images of the remainder — the cut — and of boundary points of the whole image, and of
nothing else.

The proof is a three-way case split. A point `p` of `frontier (f '' s)` lies in `closure (f '' U)`,
so if it is not on `frontier (f '' U)` it is a value `f w` with `w` in one of the three covering
sets. It cannot come from `s`, since `f '' s` is open and therefore disjoint from its own frontier;
and it cannot come from `t`, since `f '' t` is then an open neighbourhood of `p`, which must meet
`f '' s`, contradicting disjointness of the two images. So `w ∈ u`.

The source carries no topology; the sides enter topologically only through their images, which are
asked to be open and disjoint, and that is all the argument uses of them. What is asked of the
sides themselves is purely set-theoretic: `s ⊆ U` and the covering `U ⊆ s ∪ t ∪ u`. In particular
`t` need not lie in `U`, and neither side need be open or disjoint from the other. A consumer whose
map is open and injective on two disjoint open sides supplies both image hypotheses, as the
conformal one below does through the open mapping theorem and `Disjoint.image`.

## What a set's frontier sees of a subset

A subset `A` of a set `V` cannot reach `frontier V` except through its own frontier:

> `frontier V ∩ closure A = frontier V ∩ frontier A`

(`TauCeti.frontier_inter_closure_eq_frontier_inter_frontier`). The reason is that `closure A` is
`A ∪ frontier A`, and a point of `A` on `frontier V` is already on `frontier A`: it is adherent to
`A` and, since `interior A ⊆ interior V`, it is not interior to `A`. So the part of `frontier V`
that `A` clings to has two interchangeable descriptions — as the reach of `closure A`, and as the
meeting of two frontiers. The first is the one an argument about limits of points of `A` produces;
the second is the one a diameter estimate consumes, `frontier` being where the estimates of a
domain-splitting argument live.

## Consumers

The straddling, splitting and clinging lemmas serve Carathéodory's boundary correspondence for
conformal maps. The first does so through `TauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Module/DiamFrontier.lean`: a
ray leaving a bounded set crosses its frontier, which is what makes the frontier of such a set as
wide as the set itself. The second is the splitting step of
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/CutDiameter.lean`, where `s` and `t` are the two sides of a
circular crosscut of a domain and `u` is the crosscut arc. The third is what lets
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/ClusterSet.lean` identify the boundary piece that one side of
such a crosscut cuts off, whose description as a union of cluster sets is naturally a statement
about a closure. The image and finite-union lemmas are used quite differently, for a partial
homeomorphism of a real coordinate space and for the frontier of a finite union of unit translates
of a lattice region. Nothing here is specific to any of those uses; no lemma mentions a metric,
let alone a holomorphic map.

## Main results

* `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty` — a preconnected set meeting both a set and its
  complement meets the frontier of that set.
* `TauCeti.frontier_image_subset_image_union_frontier_image` — for a set split into two sides with
  disjoint open images plus a remainder, the frontier of the image of the side lying in that set
  lies on the image of the remainder and on the frontier of the image of the whole.
* `TauCeti.frontier_inter_closure_eq_frontier_inter_frontier` — the frontier of a set meets the
  closure of a subset exactly where it meets that subset's frontier.
* `TauCeti.frontier_image_subset_of_closure_subset` — for an open injective map whose image
  closure adds at most a set `t`, the frontier of an image lies on the image of the frontier,
  together with `t`.
* `TauCeti.frontier_iUnion_subset` — the frontier of a union over a finite index type lies in the
  union of the frontiers.

/-- **A preconnected set that meets both a set and its complement meets its frontier.** If `S` is
preconnected and contains a point of `V` and a point outside `V`, then `S` meets `frontier V`.

Nothing is assumed about `V`; the argument is that `(frontier V)ᶜ` is the union of the two disjoint
open sets `interior V` and `interior Vᶜ`, so a preconnected set missing the frontier is confined to
one of them and therefore cannot straddle `V`. -/

/-- **The boundary of the image of one side of a split domain lies on the image of the remainder
and on the boundary of the image of the domain.** If `U` is covered by two sets `s`, `t` with
disjoint open images together with a third set `u`, and `s ⊆ U`, then
`frontier (f '' s) ⊆ f '' u ∪ frontier (f '' U)`.

The conclusion is about `s`, the side that is asked to lie in `U`. The argument treats the two
sides alike apart from that, so a consumer with `t ⊆ U` in hand bounds `t` as well by swapping
their roles.

A frontier point of `f '' s` lies in `closure (f '' U)`, so if it is not a frontier point of
`f '' U` it is a value `f w` with `w` in one of the three covering sets: `w ∈ s` would place it
inside the open set `f '' s`, which is disjoint from its own frontier, and `w ∈ t` inside the open
set `f '' t`, which meets `f '' s` because the point is in its closure, contradicting disjointness
of the two images. So `w ∈ u`.

The source carries no topology at all: `U` and the three sets covering it are constrained only by
the two set-theoretic hypotheses `hsU : s ⊆ U` and `hcov : U ⊆ s ∪ t ∪ u`, while every topological
hypothesis, and the conclusion, lives in the target. In particular `t` need not lie in `U`, and
the two sides need be neither open nor disjoint nor separated by injectivity — only their images
need be open and disjoint, which is what the argument uses and what an injective open map on two
disjoint open sides supplies. -/

variable {X : Type*} [TopologicalSpace X] {A V : Set X}

/-- **The frontier of a set meets the closure of a subset exactly where it meets that subset's
frontier.** For any `A ⊆ V`,

> `frontier V ∩ closure A = frontier V ∩ frontier A`.

Writing `closure A` as `A ∪ frontier A`, the first piece brings nothing new: a point of `A` on
`frontier V` is adherent to `A` and is kept out of `interior A` by `interior A ⊆ interior V`, so it
already lies on `frontier A`. Only the inclusion `A ⊆ V` is used — `V` need be neither open nor
closed, and `A` is arbitrary.

So the part of `frontier V` that `A` clings to may be described either as its meeting with
`closure A` or as its meeting with `frontier A`. An argument about limits of points of `A` produces
the first; a diameter estimate obtained by splitting `V` into pieces consumes the second. -/

  {t : Set Y}

/-- **The frontier of an image lies on the image of the frontier, plus whatever the closure adds.**
For an open injective `f` whose image closure satisfies `closure (f '' s) ⊆ f '' closure s ∪ t`,

> `frontier (f '' s) ⊆ f '' frontier s ∪ t`.

The extra set `t` absorbs whatever an unbounded direction of `s` escapes to: without it the
inclusion would say that the frontier of an image is the image of a frontier, which fails as soon
as `f` sends a divergent sequence somewhere convergent. A consumer supplies `t` together with the
closure hypothesis, typically from a compactness statement about the image; it is often a single
point, but nothing in the argument needs that.

Openness and injectivity are both used, and neither can be dropped: openness keeps the image of
the interior inside the interior of the image, and injectivity is what turns a difference of
images into the image of a difference. -/

/-- **The frontier of a finite union lies in the union of the frontiers.** Finiteness is
essential, not a convenience of the proof: for an infinite union the inclusion fails — the

frontier all of `ℝ`. -/
