# Twisting the coefficients of a Dirichlet series by a power of the index

Multiplying the `n`-th coefficient of a Dirichlet series by `n ^ (-z)` translates the series by
`z`: the `n`-th term becomes `f n * n ^ (-z) / n ^ s = f n / n ^ (s + z)`, so the twisted series
at `s` is the original one at `s + z`. The identity is termwise, hence needs no convergence
hypothesis; at a point where neither series converges both sides are Mathlib's junk value `0`.

The purely imaginary parameters `z = -u * I` are the ones a Hecke character twisted by
`N(I) ^ (i u)` produces. They translate the series in the imaginary (vertical) direction, so a
pole of the original series at `s = 1` becomes a pole of the twisted one at `s = 1 + i u`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LSeries.term_mul_natCast_cpow_neg` and
  `TauCeti.LSeries.LSeries_mul_natCast_cpow_neg`: the term and the value of the twisted series
  at `s` are those of the original series at `s + z`.
