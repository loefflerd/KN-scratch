# Terms of a Dirichlet series with nonnegative coefficients at a real point

At a real point `sigma`, the terms of a Dirichlet series with nonnegative coefficients are
themselves nonnegative reals. Each term therefore equals its own norm, plain summability at `sigma`
is already absolute summability, and the value of the series is the sum of the norms of its terms.
These are the facts that turn a bound on the value `LSeries a sigma` into a bound on
`∑' n, ‖LSeries.term a sigma n‖`, which is the shape a comparison or truncation argument needs.

Mathlib's `Mathlib/NumberTheory/LSeries/Positivity.lean` records the positivity of the *values* of
such a series; the statements here are about its individual terms.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.LSeries.term_eq_ofReal_norm_of_nonneg`: a nonnegative coefficient makes the term at a
  real point equal to its own norm.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.summable_norm_term_of_nonneg`: for nonnegative coefficients, summability at a
  real point is absolute summability.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.LSeries_eq_ofReal_tsum_norm_of_nonneg`: for nonnegative coefficients, the value
  at a real point is the sum of the norms of the terms.
