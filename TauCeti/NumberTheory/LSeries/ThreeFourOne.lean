# The 3-4-1 positivity combination

This file packages the elementary positivity input in the classical `3-4-1` argument for
nonvanishing of Dirichlet series. For a phase `z` on the complex unit circle,

```text
3 + 4 Re(z) + Re(z²) = 2 (1 + Re(z))² ≥ 0.
```

The weights `3`, `4`, and `1` are nonnegative. We record their expression as a finite nonnegative
trigonometric combination and prove the corresponding inequality for logarithms of Euler factors.
These results contain no continuation, nonvanishing, or character-specific hypotheses; downstream
applications provide those analytic inputs separately.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.LSeries.isNonnegativeTrigonometricCombination_threeFourOne` packages the frequencies
  `0`, `1`, and `2` with weights `3`, `4`, and `1`.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.threeFourOne_re_neg_log_one_sub_nonneg` is the corresponding inequality for
  logarithms of Euler factors in the open unit disk.

## Provenance

The `3-4-1` argument is classical; see Davenport, *Multiplicative Number Theory*, Chapter 4.
The logarithmic form specializes the private lemma `DirichletCharacter.re_log_comb_nonneg'` in
Mathlib's `Mathlib/NumberTheory/LSeries/Nonvanishing.lean`, by Michael Stoll and David Loeffler,
through `TauCeti.sum_re_neg_log_one_sub_nonneg`.
