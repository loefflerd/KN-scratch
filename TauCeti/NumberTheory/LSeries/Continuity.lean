# Continuity of an L-series on a closed half-plane of summability

If a Dirichlet series is summable at `s`, then at every point `z` with `s.re ≤ z.re` its terms
have norms at most those of the terms at `s`, so the series converges uniformly on the closed
half-plane `{z | s.re ≤ z.re}` and `LSeries a` is continuous there. On the vertical line
`s + ℝ * I` through `s` the norms even agree exactly, and continuity along that line is a special
case of the half-plane statement.

Mathlib's `LSeries_differentiableOn` gives more, but only *strictly* inside the half-plane of
absolute convergence: it needs `abscissaOfAbsConv a < s.re`, whereas `LSeriesSummable a s` only
gives `abscissaOfAbsConv a ≤ s.re`. The line through a point of summability may therefore be the
boundary line of that half-plane, which is exactly the situation in the Wiener--Ikehara argument.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LSeries.continuousOn_LSeries`: `LSeries a` is continuous on the closed half-plane
  `{z | s.re ≤ z.re}` whenever `LSeriesSummable a s`.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.continuous_LSeries_vertical`: `fun t : ℝ ↦ LSeries a (s + t * I)` is continuous
  whenever `LSeriesSummable a s`.
* `TauCeti.LSeries.tendsto_LSeries_nhdsGT`: the real one-sided limit of `LSeries a` at a real
  point of summability is the value there.

/-- A Dirichlet series summable at `s` converges uniformly on the closed half-plane
`{z | s.re ≤ z.re}`, hence is continuous there.

Mathlib's `LSeries_differentiableOn` gives more on the *open* half-plane cut out by the abscissa
of absolute convergence, but says nothing on its boundary line, which is where the
Wiener--Ikehara argument works. -/
