# Nonvanishing on the line `Re s = 1` from a 3-4-1 bound

The classical `3-4-1` argument proves that an `L`-series does not vanish on the line `Re s = 1`
in two steps. The first is arithmetic: an Euler product and the positivity of
`3 + 4 cos θ + cos 2θ` give, for real `σ > 1`,

```text
1 ≤ ‖L₀(σ) ^ 3 * L₁(σ + it) ^ 4 * L₂(σ + 2it)‖,
```

where `L₀` is the series of the trivial character, `L₁` that of a character `χ`, and `L₂` that of
`χ²`. The second step is analytic and uses no arithmetic: if `L₀(σ) = O((σ - 1)⁻¹)` as `σ → 1⁺`,
`L₂` stays bounded near `1 + 2it`, and `L₁` is differentiable at `1 + it` and vanishes there,
then as `σ → 1⁺` the product is `O((σ - 1)⁻³ (σ - 1)⁴) = O(σ - 1)`, contradicting the
lower bound. This file proves the second step for arbitrary functions, so that each family of
`L`-series needs to supply only its own `3-4-1` bound and its analytic inputs.

The growth condition on `f₀` is the one-sided bound `f₀(σ) = O((σ - 1)⁻¹)` as real `σ → 1⁺`.
It follows from a limit of `(σ - 1) f₀(σ)` as `σ → 1⁺`, which is how such a bound is usually
available for a Dedekind zeta function; `TauCeti.isBigO_inv_sub_one_of_tendsto_sub_one_mul`
records that implication.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LSeries.ne_zero_of_threeFourOne`: the `3-4-1` bound together with the bound
  `f₀(σ) = O((σ - 1)⁻¹)`, differentiability of `f₁` at `1 + it` and continuity of `f₂` at
  `1 + 2it` forces `f₁ (1 + it) ≠ 0`.

  `L`-functions. Here it is separated from the Dirichlet characters.

/-- **The `3-4-1` nonvanishing criterion.** Let `f₀`, `f₁`, `f₂` be complex functions and `t` real.
Suppose that, as `σ → 1⁺` through real values,

* `1 ≤ ‖f₀(σ) ^ 3 * f₁(σ + it) ^ 4 * f₂(σ + 2it)‖` eventually;
* `f₀(σ) = O((σ - 1)⁻¹)`;

and that `f₁` is complex differentiable at `1 + it` and `f₂` is continuous at `1 + 2it`. Then
`f₁ (1 + it) ≠ 0`.

The bound is the one an Euler product and `3 + 4 cos θ + cos 2θ ≥ 0` give when `f₀`, `f₁`, `f₂` are
the series of the trivial character, of a character `χ`, and of `χ²`; the analytic hypotheses are
where a continuation of these series across `Re s = 1` is used. -/
