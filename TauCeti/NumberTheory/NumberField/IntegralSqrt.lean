# Square roots of integers as algebraic integers

An element `x` of a field `K` with `x² = d` for an integer `d` is integral over `ℤ` (its square
is an integer, which is integral); this file packages such an `x` as an element
`NumberField.integralSqrt hx` of the ring of integers `𝓞 K`, together with its two
defining identities: its image in `K` is `x`, and it squares to `d` in `𝓞 K`.

This is the shared square-root packaging used by the multiquadratic Layer 1 files: the
splitting law (`TauCeti.NumberTheory.Multiquadratic.MultiquadraticSplitting`) moves the
generators `√dᵢ` into `𝓞 K` to compare residues, and the Frobenius computation
(`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Frobenius`) applies the arithmetic-Frobenius congruence,
which lives on `𝓞 K`, to a square root.

When `d` is not a rational square, `X² - d` is irreducible over `ℚ`, so it is the minimal
polynomial of `x` over `ℚ`; since `ℤ` is integrally closed in `ℚ` and `x` is integral, it is also
the minimal polynomial over `ℤ`. That last identity is the standing hypothesis `hmin` of the
quadratic-field API in `TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Quadratic` and of the multiquadratic
files built on it, so it is recorded here once.

For `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, the half-generator `(1 + x) / 2` is integral as well. This is the
integral generator that separates conjugates at primes above `2`.

## Main definitions and results

* `TauCeti.sq_one_add_div_two_sub_self`: the quadratic relation for the half-generator.
* `TauCeti.isIntegral_one_add_div_two_of_sq_eq`: the half-generator is integral when
  `d ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.
* `NumberField.integralSqrt`: the packaging in `𝓞 K`, with
  `NumberField.algebraMap_integralSqrt` and `NumberField.integralSqrt_sq`.
* `NumberField.minpoly_integralSqrt`: its minimal polynomial over `ℤ` is `X² - d`,
  provided `d` is not a rational square.
