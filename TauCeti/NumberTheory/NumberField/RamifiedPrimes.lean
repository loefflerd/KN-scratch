# The ramified rational primes of a number field

The genus theory of a quadratic field is governed by the number `t` of rational primes that ramify
in it: the genus field has degree `2 ^ t` over `ℚ` and the `2`-rank of the narrow class group is
`t - 1`. This file names that set of primes and records its basic properties.

Mathlib phrases ramification of a rational prime `p` in a number field `K` as
`Algebra.IsUnramifiedIn (𝓞 K) (Ideal.span {(p : ℤ)})`, and characterises it by divisibility of the
discriminant (`NumberField.not_dvd_discr_iff_isUnramifiedIn`). We package the negation as a set of
natural primes, which is the form in which `t` is counted.

## Main definitions

* `NumberField.ramifiedPrimes`: the set of natural primes ramifying in `K`.

## Main results

* `NumberField.mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_dvd_discr`: a prime ramifies iff it divides the
  discriminant.
* `NumberField.coprime_natAbs_discr_of_isUnramifiedIn`: an unramified prime is coprime to the
  discriminant.
* `AlgEquiv.ramifiedPrimes_eq`: isomorphic number fields have the same ramified primes.
* `NumberField.ramifiedPrimes_rat`: no prime ramifies in `ℚ`.
* `NumberField.finite_ramifiedPrimes`: only finitely many primes ramify.
* `NumberField.ramifiedPrimes_nonempty`: some prime ramifies, unless `K = ℚ`
  (Minkowski, via `NumberField.exists_not_isUnramifiedIn`).

-- development, CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density (Apache-2.0), branch `development` at
-- `8575c9df1ae0a61120ab5c964c7911414254bec7`. There `CebotarevDensity/Abelian.lean` carries it
-- undischarged throughout, obtaining `p ∤ discr E` from
-- `NumberField.not_dvd_discr_iff_forall_liesOver` inline. The statement below is that hypothesis;
-- deriving it from `Algebra.IsUnramifiedIn` is not done in the source, which propagates it.

/-- **An unramified prime is coprime to the discriminant.** If the rational prime `p` is
unramified in `K` then it does not divide `NumberField.discr K`, so `|discr K|` and `p` are
coprime.

This is `mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_dvd_discr` in the form the cyclotomic-crossing lemmas consume.
They take `((NumberField.discr _).natAbs).Coprime m` as an undischarged hypothesis, and
`IsCyclotomicExtension.finrank_eq_totient` records in its implementation notes that a caller is
expected to arrange it "by choosing `m` to be a prime unramified in `K`". This is that sentence
as a lemma, so the hypothesis can be discharged rather than propagated. -/
