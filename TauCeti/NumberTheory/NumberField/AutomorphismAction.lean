# Automorphisms acting on the ring of integers

A ring automorphism of a field restricts to its ring of integers, because it preserves
integrality. This file records how that restricted action relates to the ambient one: the
structure map `𝓞 K → K` is equivariant, carrying `σ • z` to `σ` applied to the image of `z`.
It also records that restriction to a normal subfield commutes with the map between the two
rings of integers.

For a tower `F / K` of fields it also records that the `Gal(F/K)`-action on `𝓞 F` commutes with
the `𝓞 K`-scalar action: a `K`-algebra automorphism fixes `K` pointwise, hence fixes the image of
`𝓞 K`. Mathlib supplies the corresponding `SMulCommClass` only over the base `ℤ`
(`integralClosure`'s own instance, with `ℤ` the ring `𝓞 F` is integral over), which is what a
Frobenius over `ℚ` needs; a *relative* Frobenius over a general base `K` needs this one.

`𝓞 K` is the integral closure of `ℤ`, and any ring automorphism of `K` preserves `ℤ`-integrality,
so the base ring `R` over which `σ` is linear is irrelevant to both statement and proof; it is a
free parameter, specialized to `ℚ` by the callers. Nothing here needs `K` to be finite-dimensional
either, so `[NumberField K]` is not assumed.

This is the `AlgEquiv` specialization of Mathlib's `integralClosure.coe_smul`, which is stated
for an arbitrary `[Group G] [MulSemiringAction G K]` and therefore cannot phrase the right-hand
side as function application. Callers want exactly that applied form, so the specialization is
recorded once here rather than reconstructed at each use site.

## Main results

* `NumberField.algebraMap_smul_eq_apply`: `algebraMap (𝓞 K) K (σ • z) = σ (algebraMap (𝓞 K) K z)`.
* `NumberField.algebraMap_restrictNormal_smul`: mapping the action of a restricted automorphism
  into the top ring of integers gives the action of the original automorphism.
* `NumberField.RingOfIntegers.smulCommClass`: `Gal(F/K)` acting on `𝓞 F` commutes with the
  `𝓞 K`-action.
* `AlgEquiv.mapAlgEquiv_symm_autCongr_smul`: restriction to rings of integers intertwines
  conjugation of automorphisms along an algebra equivalence.

/-- **`algebraMap` intertwines the automorphism actions on `𝓞 K` and on `K`.** The action on the
ring of integers is the restriction of the action on `K` (`integralClosure.coe_smul`), so the
structure map sends `σ • z` to `σ` applied to the image of `z`.

/-- **The Galois action on `𝓞 F` commutes with the `𝓞 K`-action.** A `K`-algebra automorphism of
`F` fixes `K` pointwise, so it fixes the image of `𝓞 K` in `F` and therefore commutes with
multiplication by it.

This is the relative form of Mathlib's `SMulCommClass G R (integralClosure R K)`, which for
`𝓞 F = integralClosure ℤ F` gives only the base ring `ℤ`. Neither field has to be a number
field. -/
