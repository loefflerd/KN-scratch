# Contracting a Frobenius fiber to the fixed field

Fix `σ ∈ Gal(L/K)` and let `E = L ^ ⟨σ⟩`. If `σ` is an arithmetic Frobenius at a prime `Q` of
`𝓞 L` unramified over `𝓞 K`, then over `E` there is a relative Frobenius at `Q` restricting to
`σ`. That is the direction a fixed-field count needs from this file.

The converse — recovering `σ` from a relative Frobenius at residue degree one — holds for any
intermediate field, so it lives in `Frobenius/Tower.lean` as
`NumberField.isArithFrobAt_restrictScalars_of_inertiaDeg_eq_one`. Injectivity of contraction comes
from `Ideal.eq_of_smul_eq_of_liesOver_under_fixedField`.

## Main results

* `Ideal.exists_isArithFrobAt_and_restrictScalars_eq`: a prime carrying `σ` has, over the
  fixed field, a relative Frobenius restricting to `σ`.
