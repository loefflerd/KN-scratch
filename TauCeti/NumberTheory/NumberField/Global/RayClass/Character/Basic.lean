# Ray class characters

A ray class character of a modulus `𝔪` is a multiplicative character of its finite ray class
group with values in the complex units.  Composing with `idealClass 𝔪` evaluates it on the
nonzero integral ideals prime to the finite part of `𝔪`; the coprimality proof remains in the
domain because `idealClass 𝔪` is defined only on those ideals.

When `𝔪 ∣ 𝔫`, pullback along the surjective transition `classMap : Cl_𝔫 → Cl_𝔪` induces a
character of the larger modulus.  These pullbacks are injective, compose along chains of moduli,
and agree with the inclusion of integral ideals prime to the larger modulus.  This is the finite
character API used in ray-class counting and in the factorization of cyclotomic Galois
characters.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter`: multiplicative complex-unit characters of a
  ray class group;
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.onIdeals`: evaluation on integral ideals prime
  to the modulus;
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.induced`: pullback of a character along a change
  of modulus.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.ext`: a ray class character is
  determined by its values on integral ideals;
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.induced_injective`: increasing the modulus does
  not identify distinct characters;
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.onIdeals_induced`: change of modulus commutes
  with evaluation on ideals;
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.RayClassCharacter.exists_induced_eq_iff_of_finitePart_eq`: a
  character is induced from a modulus with the same finite part exactly when it is trivial on the
  sign classes of the forgotten real places.
