# The residue-and-sign presentation of the congruence quotient

Let `𝔪` be a modulus of a number field `K`.  Congruence to one modulo `𝔪` is two independent
conditions on an element of `primeToSubgroup 𝔪`: reduction to one in `(𝓞 K ⧸ 𝔪.finitePart)ˣ`, and
positivity at each real place selected by `𝔪.infinitePart`.  This file packages the two conditions
into one homomorphism

```text
residueSignHom 𝔪 :
  primeToSubgroup 𝔪 →* (𝓞 K ⧸ 𝔪.finitePart)ˣ × (𝔪.infinitePart → ℤˣ)
```

and proves that it is surjective with kernel exactly `congruenceSubgroup 𝔪`.  The resulting
isomorphism `residueSignEquiv` computes the relative index

```text
(congruenceSubgroup 𝔪).relIndex (primeToSubgroup 𝔪)
  = Nat.card (𝓞 K ⧸ 𝔪.finitePart)ˣ * 2 ^ 𝔪.infinitePart.card,
```

which is the residue-and-sign factor of the ray class number formula — the factor *before* the
image of the global units is divided out — and strengthens the bare finiteness recorded by
`congruenceSubgroup_finiteIndex`.

Surjectivity is the arithmetic content and is *not* a chinese-remainder statement: the residue
class and the signs have to be realized by one and the same element of `Kˣ`, so the proof runs
through weak approximation at the mixed set of places consisting of the primes dividing
`𝔪.finitePart` together with all real places
(`exists_fieldUnit_valuation_sub_lt_and_signHom_eq`).  An approximation to a chosen integral
representative of the residue class, closely enough that `v.valuation K` of their difference stays
below `exp (-𝔪.exponent v)` at each prime of the support, has the same reduction as that
representative: the quotient of the two then differs from one by at most that much, which is the
congruence condition recorded by `residue_eq_one_iff`.

The global units of `K` are nowhere quotiented out here.  Their image in this quotient is the
obstruction that glues the residue-unit and sign factors to the ordinary class group inside the
ray class group, and it is why the ray class group is not the product of the three.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.residueSignHom`: the reduction-and-signs homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.residueSignEquiv`: the induced isomorphism from the congruence
  quotient.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.residueSignHom_eq_one_iff` and
  `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.ker_residueSignHom`: the kernel is the congruence subgroup.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.residueSignHom_surjective`: every residue unit and sign pattern is
  realized simultaneously, together with its archimedean half
  `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.modulusSignHom_comp_primeToSubgroup_surjective`.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.relIndex_congruenceSubgroup`: the exact relative index.

/-- **The residue-and-sign presentation of a modulus.**  An element of `Kˣ` that is a unit at every
prime dividing `𝔪.finitePart` has both a reduction in `(𝓞 K ⧸ 𝔪.finitePart)ˣ` and a sign at each
real place selected by `𝔪`; congruence to one modulo `𝔪` is exactly the vanishing of both.

The two factors are the finite and the archimedean halves of the ray class number formula. -/

/-! ### Surjectivity -/

/-- **The residue-and-sign presentation is surjective.**  Every residue unit modulo the finite part
and every pattern of signs at the real places of the modulus are realized simultaneously by one
element of `Kˣ` that is a unit at the finite part.

The two prescriptions are independent: no compatibility between a residue class and a sign pattern
is required, which is what makes the congruence quotient a direct product. -/

is read off, and it is where the finite and the archimedean data of a modulus become independent
coordinates. -/

/-- **The exact relative index of the congruence subgroup.**  The elements that are units at the
finite part of `𝔪`, modulo those congruent to one, are counted by the residue units modulo the
finite part times two for each real place of the infinite part.

This refines the finiteness statement `congruenceSubgroup_finiteIndex` to an equality.  It is the
residue-and-sign factor entering the ray class number formula, which multiplies the class number
only after the image of the global units in this quotient is divided out; that image is the
obstruction described in the module docstring. -/
