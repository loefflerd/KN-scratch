# Derivatives of ideal-indexed Dirichlet series

Differentiating an ideal term `idealTerm K f s I = f I / N(I) ^ s` in `s` returns the same term
weighted by `-log N(I)`.  Summing over the nonzero integral ideals, the derivative of the
norm-regrouped `L`-series is therefore, up to a sign, the ideal-indexed Dirichlet series of the
*logarithmic weighting* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.logMul` of `f`, the pointwise product of
`f` with `log N(I)`.

This file proves that identity, its iterated form, and the resulting expression of the logarithmic
derivative as a quotient of two ideal-indexed sums.  The norm-regrouped derivative, its iterated
form, and the logarithmic-derivative result assume that `s` lies strictly to the right of
`TauCeti.idealAbscissaOfAbsConv K f`, the abscissa of absolute convergence of the ideal-indexed
series; the logarithmic weight can destroy summability on the boundary line itself, which is why
a point of convergence strictly to the left is what the estimates consume.

Two facts do the work.  Regrouping by absolute norm turns `logMul` into Mathlib's `LSeries.logMul`,
because the weight `log N(I)` is constant on a norm fibre
(`TauCeti.normCoeff_logMul`); and a logarithmic weight leaves the ideal-indexed series summable
strictly to the right of any point of absolute convergence
(`TauCeti.summable_log_absNorm_mul_norm_idealTerm_of_re_lt_re`).  Mathlib's `LSeries_hasDerivAt`
then supplies the calculus, and `TauCeti.regroupByNorm` converts its conclusion back to a sum over
ideals.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.logMul`: the pointwise product of an ideal arithmetic function
  with `log N(I)`, the ideal-indexed counterpart of Mathlib's `LSeries.logMul`.  Its `m`-fold
  iterate weights by `log N(I) ^ m` (`TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.logMul_iterate_apply`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hasDerivAt_idealTerm`: the derivative in `s` of an ideal term is the term itself,
  weighted by `-log N(I)`.
* `TauCeti.normCoeff_logMul`: regrouping by absolute norm carries the ideal-indexed logarithmic
  weight to Mathlib's.
* `TauCeti.summable_idealTerm_logMul_of_re_lt_re`: a logarithmic weight preserves absolute
  convergence strictly to the right.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.hasDerivAt_LSeries_normCoeff` and
  `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.deriv_LSeries_normCoeff`: the derivative of the regrouped
  `L`-series is `-∑ I, log N(I) f I N(I) ^ (-s)`, summed over the nonzero integral ideals.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.iteratedDeriv_LSeries_normCoeff`: the `m`-th derivative, with
  the weight `log N(I) ^ m`.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.logDeriv_LSeries_normCoeff`: the logarithmic derivative as the
  quotient of the two ideal-indexed sums.
* `TauCeti.IdealArithmeticFunction.differentiableOn_LSeries_normCoeff`: absolute convergence of
  an ideal-indexed series throughout an open set makes its norm-regrouped `L`-series holomorphic
  there.
