# The primes of a number field ramifying in a finite extension

For an extension `L / K` of number fields, a height-one prime `𝔭` of `𝓞 K` is *ramified in `L`*
when some prime `Q` of `𝓞 L` lying over it is ramified, i.e. when

`¬ ∀ (Q : Ideal (𝓞 L)) [Q.IsPrime] [Q.LiesOver 𝔭.asIdeal], Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt (𝓞 K) Q`.

Only finitely many `𝔭` are ramified, because each of them is the contraction of a prime dividing
the different ideal `differentIdeal (𝓞 K) (𝓞 L)`, which is nonzero and so has finitely many prime
divisors. That finiteness is what lets the ramified primes be packaged as a `Finset`, which is the
form Chebotarev's exceptional set is used in: the density statements discard `ramifiedPrimes K L`
and argue about the complement.

The ramification condition is spelled out with Mathlib's `Algebra.IsUnramifiedAt` rather than
wrapped in a named predicate, matching how the roadmap states it. A `Prop`-valued abbreviation for
"`𝔭` is unramified in `L`" would duplicate `Algebra.IsUnramifiedIn`.

## Main definitions

* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ramifiedPrimes`: the finite set of height-one primes of `𝓞 K` that
  ramify in `L`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eventually_isUnramifiedAt_liesOver`: almost every finite place has only
  unramified places above it.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff`: the defining condition for membership.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.under_notMem_ramifiedPrimes_iff_isUnramifiedAt`: in a Galois
  extension, unramifiedness can be tested at one prime above the base prime.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ramifiedPrimes_subset_ramifiedPrimes`: for a tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ M`, every
  prime of `K` ramifying in `L` also ramifies in `M`.

## Relation to the absolute `NumberField.ramifiedPrimes`

Every name used here already exists one namespace up, and this is deliberate rather than an
oversight. `TauCeti/NumberTheory/NumberField/RamifiedPrimes.lean` carries

* `NumberField.ramifiedPrimes (K) : Set ℕ`, the *rational* primes ramifying in `K`,
* `@[simp] NumberField.mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff`, proved by `Iff.rfl`, and
* `NumberField.finite_ramifiedPrimes`,

i.e. the same short names, in the same shape. They are kept apart rather than unified:

* They are the same *shape* — "not `Algebra.IsUnramifiedIn` the top ring at an ideal of the base"
  — but at different bases. The absolute one is `ℤ`-to-`𝓞 K`; this one is `𝓞 K`-to-`𝓞 L`. Neither
  is an instance of the other without also transporting the carrier.
* The carriers genuinely differ: `Set ℕ` against `Finset (HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))`. For `K = ℚ`
  the two agree only through `𝓞 ℚ ≃ ℤ` and `HeightOneSpectrum ℤ ≃` the rational primes, and
  neither identification is definitional.
* Generalising the absolute version instead would change its carrier, and Tau Ceti keeps no
  compatibility shims, so every use would have to move in this PR — ten files on `main` reference
  that API, seven of them under `Multiquadratic/`. Its `Set ℕ` packaging is, in its own docstring,
  "the form in which `t` is counted" for genus theory.

Two consequences to be aware of when using this file. First, `NumberField.Chebotarev` is nested
inside `NumberField`, so within it a bare `ramifiedPrimes` or `mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff` resolves to
the declaration here and shadows the absolute one; a `Chebotarev` file that also wants the
absolute notion must write `_root_.NumberField.ramifiedPrimes`. (The finiteness lemma is private,
so its name collides only inside this file.) Second, both `_iff` lemmas are
`@[simp]`, but their left-hand sides head-match on different types — membership in a `Set ℕ`
against membership in a `Finset (HeightOneSpectrum (𝓞 K))` — so `simp` never has to choose
between them.

`Set.Finite` over `Ideal (𝓞 K)` phrased through a source-local unramifiedness predicate. The
covering argument through the different ideal is the source's; the carrier is the roadmap's.

Private, and stated for the underlying `Set` rather than for `ramifiedPrimes` itself, because its
only role is to *build* that `Finset`; consumers take finiteness from the `Finset` and membership
from `mem_ramifiedPrimes_iff`. The absolute analogue `_root_.NumberField.finite_ramifiedPrimes`
runs the other way round, its `ramifiedPrimes` being a `Set` that the lemma then cuts down. -/
