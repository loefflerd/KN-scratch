# Nonvanishing of Galois character series on the line `Re s = 1`

Let `F / K` be a finite Galois extension of number fields and `χ` a character of `Gal(F/K)`. On
`Re s > 1` the `L`-series of `galoisCharacterWeight χ` does not vanish, by its Euler product. This
file gives criteria for a function agreeing on `Re s > 1` with the `L`-series of
`galoisCharacterWeight χ` to be nonzero at a point `s` of the line `Re s = 1`. In particular the
series of the trivial character, which is the Dedekind zeta function of `K` with the Euler factors
at the primes ramified in `F` deleted, does not vanish at any `s ≠ 1` with `Re s = 1`.

Together with the continuation across `Re s = 1`, this is what makes the logarithmic derivatives
of these series, with the pole of the trivial one subtracted, continuous on `Re s ≥ 1`: the
boundary behaviour required to apply a Tauberian theorem to the Frobenius von Mangoldt series.

The criterion is the `3-4-1` criterion `TauCeti.UnitaryIdealWeight.ne_zero_of_eqOn_LSeries` for
the unitary weight `galoisCharacterUnitaryWeight χ`, whose pointwise square is the unitary weight
of `χ²`. The remaining results handle the square: for `χ² = 1` its series is the trivial one, which
continues across `Re s = 1` away from `s = 1` by
`TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_eq_LSeries_ofBadPrimes_sub`.

## Main results

* `MonoidHom.LSeries_galoisCharacterWeight_ne_zero`: the series of `χ` is nonzero on `Re s > 1`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ne_zero_of_eqOn_LSeries_galoisCharacterWeight`: a continuation of the
  series of `χ`, differentiable at `s = 1 + it`, is nonzero at `s` provided some continuation of
  the series of `χ²` is continuous at `1 + 2it`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ne_zero_of_eqOn_LSeries_galoisCharacterWeight_of_sq_eq_one`: for
  `χ² = 1`, a continuation of the series of `χ` is nonzero on `Re s = 1` away from `s = 1`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.ne_zero_of_eqOn_LSeries_galoisCharacterWeight_one`: a continuation of
  the trivial-character series is nonzero on `Re s = 1` away from `s = 1`.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.exists_continuousOn_eq_neg_logDeriv_galoisCharacterWeight_one_sub`:
  the regularized logarithmic derivative of the trivial character extends continuously to
  `Re s ≥ 1`.
