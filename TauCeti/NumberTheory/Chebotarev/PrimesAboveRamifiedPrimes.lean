# The primes of a number field above those ramifying in another

For an extension `L / K` of number fields and a further number field `E` over `K`, this file
collects the height-one primes of `𝓞 E` whose contraction to `𝓞 K` ramifies in `L`. There are
finitely many, so they form a `Finset`.

`E` is unrelated to `L`: the condition constrains the prime of `K` below, and says nothing about
how the prime behaves in `L / E`.

## Main definitions

* `NumberField.Chebotarev.primesAboveRamifiedPrimes`: the finite set of height-one primes of
  `𝓞 E` lying above `ramifiedPrimes K L`.

## Main results

* `NumberField.Chebotarev.mem_primesAboveRamifiedPrimes_iff`: the defining condition for
  membership.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.under_mem_primesAboveRamifiedPrimes_of_not_isUnramifiedAt`: a prime
  below a ramified prime in a tower satisfies the defining condition.
* `NumberField.Chebotarev.under_mem_primesAboveRamifiedPrimes_iff_inertia_ne_bot`: in a
  Galois tower, membership of the contraction is equivalent to nontrivial inertia upstairs.

## Comparison with ramification in `L / E`

Nothing here assumes `E` embeds in `L`, so in general there is no ramification in `L / E` to
compare against: membership is a condition on the prime of `K` below `𝔓`, and nothing else.

When a compatible tower `K → E → L` does exist, the two conditions are still not the same one.
Ramification indices multiply along a tower, `e(Q/𝔭) = e(Q/𝔓) · e(𝔓/𝔭)`, so a prime of `E`
ramifying in `L / E` always lies in this set. The inclusion can be strict, and that is why the
condition is imposed below rather than on `L / E`.

For example, take `K = ℚ` and `L = ℚ(∛2, ζ₃)`, so that `Gal(L/K) ≅ S₃`; let `E = ℚ(∛2)`, the field
fixed by a transposition, and let `p = 2`. The inertia group at a prime `Q` of `L` above `2` is the
cyclic group of order three, so `e(Q/2) = 3` while `e(Q/𝔓) = 1`: all of the ramification,
`e(𝔓/2) = 3`, happens below `E`. So `𝔓` is unramified in `L / E` and yet lies above a prime
ramifying in `L / K` — a witness that the inclusion is strict here.
