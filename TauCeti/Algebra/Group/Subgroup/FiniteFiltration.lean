# Finite decreasing filtrations of groups

An antitone sequence of subgroups whose first term is finite eventually stabilizes at its
intersection. In particular, it is eventually trivial whenever its intersection is trivial.
This elementary observation is useful for ramification filtrations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Subgroup.exists_forall_eq_iInf_of_antitone`: a decreasing filtration with finite first
  term eventually equals its intersection.
* `TauCeti.Subgroup.exists_forall_eq_bot_of_antitone_iInf_eq_bot`: a decreasing filtration with
  finite first term and trivial intersection is eventually trivial.
