# Holomorphic branches of `log` and of `n`-th roots on a simply connected domain

Mathlib's `Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` produces a **continuous** branch of `log ∘ g`
on a simply connected open set. The Riemann-mapping argument needs a **holomorphic** one. This file
supplies that upgrade for the logarithm, consuming Mathlib's branch rather than rebuilding it, and
then obtains the `n`-th root from it directly as `exp (L / n)`.

Note that the root branch is *not* an upgrade of Mathlib's `Complex.exists_continuousOn_pow_eq`,
which this file does not use: once the logarithm branch is holomorphic, `exp (L / n)` is holomorphic
by composition and satisfies `(exp (L / n)) ^ n = exp L = g` outright, so routing through a separate
continuous root branch would add a second continuity-to-holomorphy argument for no gain.

The upgrade is local and purely formal. Near a point `z₀`, the continuous branch `L` agrees with
`logBranch w₀ ∘ g` where `w₀ = L z₀`, the branch of the logarithm based at `w₀`: that composite is
holomorphic (the argument sits near `1`, inside the slit plane, where `Complex.log` is), and it
agrees with `L` because continuity of `L` confines `L z - w₀` to the strip `|im| < π` on which that
branch inverts `Complex.exp`. So no new analysis is involved — only the observation that a
continuous logarithm of a holomorphic nonvanishing function is automatically holomorphic.

## Attribution and upstream coordination

The mathematics here is an upgrade of prior Mathlib work, not a first proof. The logarithm and
zero-free root branches rest on two efforts of Yury Kudryashov's; the germ statement rests in
addition on Mathlib's order-of-vanishing formalization.

*The branch itself* is Mathlib's: `Complex.exists_continuousOn_eqOn_exp_comp` in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.BranchLogRoot` (© Yury Kudryashov) supplies the continuous logarithm
branch on a simply connected domain, which this file consumes rather than rebuilds. What
`TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_eqOn_exp_comp` and `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_pow_eq` add to
it is the continuity-to-holomorphy upgrade. The `n`-th root is *not* obtained from Mathlib's
continuous root API (`Complex.exists_continuousOn_pow_eq` is never used here): it is derived as
`exp (L / n)` from the upgraded holomorphic logarithm branch `L`.

*The order of vanishing* is Mathlib's too: `Mathlib.Analysis.Analytic.Order` (© Vincent Beffara;
authors Vincent Beffara and Stefan Kebekus) formalizes `analyticOrderAt` and the factorization
theory around it, on which `TauCeti.exists_eventuallyEq_pow_iff_dvd` rests throughout.
`AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_eq_natCast` supplies the factorization of a germ of finite order,
`analyticOrderAt_eq_top` identifies the germ of order `⊤` as the one vanishing near `z₀`, and
`analyticOrderAt_pow` gives the converse direction outright. What is added here is only the
assembly of those with the root branch above.

*The consumer* is the Riemann mapping construction in `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.RiemannMapping`
(© Yury Kudryashov), whose `Complex.exists_mapsTo_unitBall_injOn_deriv_ne_zero` performs the same
square-root step that the sibling file `DiscInjection.lean` re-derives on top of this API; see its
docstring for why that lemma cannot be named by an importer.

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves
holomorphic log / `n`-th-root statements (`exists_branch_log`, `exists_branch_nthRoot`)
**internally, as private lemmas**, alongside the argument principle, Hurwitz and Montel. The
`ConformalMapping` roadmap's stated contribution at these layers is therefore *named, reusable API*
rather than first proof. Accordingly the two branch declarations here are a **temporary shim**: when
the human-curated Mathlib versions land, those should be deleted and every downstream consumer
refactored onto them. That does not extend to `TauCeti.exists_eventuallyEq_pow_iff_dvd`: the
upstream statements are zero-free, like the ones they replace, so they do not subsume a germ that
vanishes.

## Roots of a germ that vanishes

The root branch needs `g` to be zero-free, so on its own it says nothing about a germ that
vanishes. Locally that gap closes by factoring the zero out: `A z = (z - z₀) ^ m • g z` with
`g z₀ ≠ 0`, so an `n`-th root of the germ exists exactly when `n` divides its order of vanishing
(`TauCeti.exists_eventuallyEq_pow_iff_dvd`), namely `(z - z₀) ^ (m / n)` times the branch above
applied to `g`. This weakens the zero-free hypothesis — the case of order `0` — to the
divisibility condition, and the converse direction shows the condition is sharp. The germ that
vanishes identically near `z₀`, of order `⊤`, is its own `n`-th root.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_eqOn_exp_comp` — a holomorphic branch of `log ∘ g`.
* `TauCeti.exists_differentiableOn_pow_eq` — a holomorphic branch of `ⁿ√g`.
* `TauCeti.exists_eventuallyEq_pow_iff_dvd` — a holomorphic germ has a holomorphic `n`-th root iff
  `n` divides its order of vanishing.
* `TauCeti.deriv_eq_logDeriv_of_eqOn_exp_comp` — the derivative of a branch of the logarithm is the
  logarithmic derivative, and so does not depend on which branch was chosen.
