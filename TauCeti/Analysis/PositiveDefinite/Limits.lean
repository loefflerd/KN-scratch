# Limits of positive-definite functions

This file derives pointwise- and locally-uniform-limit closure for
`TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite`, the positive-definite function predicate on an involutive additive
monoid, from Mathlib's closedness theorem for the cone of positive-semidefinite matrices.

This is the limit-closure item from Part C of the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap. The result is
about positive-definiteness alone for pointwise limits; as the roadmap notes, continuity needs an
additional hypothesis. Mathlib's `TendstoLocallyUniformly.continuous` provides continuity of a
locally uniform limit when the approximating functions are frequently continuous, while this file
provides the positive-definiteness conclusion.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.of_tendsto`: filter-level pointwise-limit closure for
  positive-definite functions.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.of_forall_tendsto`: the same result when every function in the
  family is positive definite.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.of_seq_tendsto`: the sequential `atTop` specialization.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.of_tendstoLocallyUniformly`: locally uniform limits of eventually
  positive-definite functions are positive definite.
