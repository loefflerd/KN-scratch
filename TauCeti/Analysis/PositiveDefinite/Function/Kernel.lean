# The positive-definite function ↔ positive-definite kernel correspondence

A positive-definite function `F : M → ℂ` on an involutive additive monoid and a positive-definite
kernel `K : M → M → ℂ` are two views of the same data, linked by the assignment
`K(a, b) = F(a + b⋆)`. This file records the forward and reverse correspondence, packages them
as an iff, and records the translation-invariant group specialization.

Both sides express nonnegativity of finite quadratic forms; the two-variable kernel is viewed
directly as a matrix and tested with Mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef` predicate.

Under the negation involution `a⋆ = -a` the kernel takes the familiar translation-invariant shape
`K(a, b) = F(a - b)`, the form in which positive definiteness is usually stated on groups such as
`ℝᵈ` or a real inner-product space. We record that specialization as a corollary parameterized by
the hypothesis `star a = -a` (Mathlib pins no such `StarAddMonoid` instance, since `star` is the
identity on a real vector space, so the negation involution is supplied as a side hypothesis rather
than an instance).

This advances the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap, Part C ("Positive-definite functions and
Bochner's theorem", `TauCetiRoadmap/OneParameterSemigroups/README.md`): the `API to develop` bullet
"the PD-function ↔ PD-kernel equivalence (`K(a, b) = F(a + b⋆)`; `F(a − b)` for a group)".
The function-side predicate `IsPositiveDefinite` lives in Tau Ceti, while the kernel side uses
Mathlib's `Matrix.PosSemidef`; this file connects them and records the group form. No Mathlib code
is vendored.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_iff_posSemidef`: the equivalence of the two predicates,
  packaging the two halves.
* `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite.posSemidef_sub` and
  `TauCeti.isPositiveDefinite_iff_posSemidef_sub`: the subtraction form
  `K(a, b) = F(a - b)` under the negation involution `star a = -a`.
