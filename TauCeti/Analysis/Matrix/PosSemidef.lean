# Analytic bounds for positive-semidefinite matrices

This file supplements the foundational API in `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.PosSemidef` with
scalar Cauchy--Schwarz and vanishing bounds for `RCLike`-valued positive-semidefinite matrices,
together with the resulting estimate for *Hankel* matrices: a sequence bounded above whose Hankel
matrix `(m, n) ↦ a (m + n)` is positive semidefinite cannot increase at the first step.

The results apply in particular to positive-definite kernels, represented directly as matrices,
but do not depend on Tau Ceti's positive-definite-function theory.

They supply the matrix prerequisites for Part C of the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap, including
the positive-definite-function/kernel correspondence and the GNS/Kolmogorov decomposition. No
Mathlib code is vendored.

## Main declarations

* `Matrix.PosSemidef.normSq_le`: scalar Cauchy--Schwarz.
* `Matrix.PosSemidef.eq_zero_of_apply_self_eq_zero_left` and
  `Matrix.PosSemidef.eq_zero_of_apply_self_eq_zero_right`: zero-diagonal vanishing.
* `Matrix.PosSemidef.norm_le_one_of_apply_self_eq_one`: the normalized scalar bound.
* `Matrix.PosSemidef.norm_le_of_norm_apply_self_le`: the diagonal bounds every entry.
* `TauCeti.sub_nonneg_of_posSemidef_hankel`: a positive-semidefinite Hankel sequence bounded above
  does not increase at the first step.
