# Characteristic functions as positive-definite functions

This file connects the quadratic-form positivity calculation for characteristic functions to
Tau Ceti's generic positive-definite-function predicate. If the involution on an additive group is
negation, then Mathlib's characteristic function `MeasureTheory.charFun μ` of a finite measure is
`TauCeti.IsPositiveDefinite`.

Together with Mathlib's continuity theorem for characteristic functions, this gives the "finite
measure's Fourier transform is continuous positive-definite" bridge lemma requested in Part C of
the `OneParameterSemigroups` roadmap, before the harder converse direction of Bochner's theorem.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.charFun_isPositiveDefinite_of_star_eq_neg`: `charFun μ` is positive definite for any
  explicit `star = -` involution.
* `TauCeti.continuous_charFun_and_isPositiveDefinite_of_star_eq_neg`: the paired continuity and
  positive-definiteness package.
* `TauCeti.isPositiveDefiniteSub_charFun`: `charFun μ` is positive definite in the
  subtraction form `TauCeti.IsPositiveDefiniteSub`, with no choice of involution.
