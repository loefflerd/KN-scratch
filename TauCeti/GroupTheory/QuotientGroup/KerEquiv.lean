# Evaluating the first isomorphism theorem on a class

Mathlib packages the first isomorphism theorem for a surjective homomorphism `φ : G →* M` as
`QuotientGroup.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective φ hφ : G ⧸ φ.ker ≃* M`. It is defined through
`QuotientGroup.quotientKerEquivOfRightInverse` applied to a right inverse extracted from `hφ`
by choice, so evaluating it on a class otherwise means unfolding that noncomputable
implementation. Likewise, `QuotientGroup.quotientKerEquivRange φ : G ⧸ φ.ker ≃* φ.range` is
built with `MulEquiv.ofBijective` from `QuotientGroup.rangeKerLift`, and Mathlib states no
evaluation rule for it.

This file records the computation rules on classes, so that users never have to. The first is
the group-theoretic counterpart of Mathlib's `RingHom.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective_apply_mk`;
both belong beside their definitions in Mathlib.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.QuotientGroup.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective_apply_mk`: the isomorphism
  `G ⧸ φ.ker ≃* M` sends the class of `g` to `φ g`; its additive counterpart is
  `TauCeti.QuotientAddGroup.quotientKerEquivOfSurjective_apply_mk`.
* `TauCeti.QuotientGroup.quotientKerEquivRange_apply_mk`: the isomorphism
  `G ⧸ φ.ker ≃* φ.range` sends the class of `g` to `φ g`; its additive counterpart is
  `TauCeti.QuotientAddGroup.quotientKerEquivRange_apply_mk`.
