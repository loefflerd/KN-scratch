# Measures invariant under addition

This file records measure formulas for finite families of disjoint additive translates.  In
lattice-point counting, the formula turns disjoint translates of a fundamental-domain cell into
measure bounds that can be compared with the number of cells.

## Main results

* `Measure.measure_biUnion_sub_mem`: a finite disjoint union of translates has measure
  equal to the number of translates times the measure of the original set.
